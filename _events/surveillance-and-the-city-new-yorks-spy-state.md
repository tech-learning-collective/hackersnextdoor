teaser: Wondering if the new year will look like 1984, join the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project Executive Director Albert Fox Cahn for a briefing on the fight to reform NYPD surveillance and protect privacy.

In this session we will learn more about the tools that the NYPD and other municipal and state agencies deploy in New York City, including facial recognition, gait detection, cell site location information, and more. The talk will examine persistent unanswered questions about the scale and scope of New York&rsquo;s surveillance network, as well as the pending litigation, regulations, and legislation that seek to reform these problems. The discussion will also include an analysis of the proposed IDNYC payment chip, congestion pricing, OMNY, and other &ldquo;smart cities&rdquo; programs that result in massive data collection and pose often-unappreciated privacy concerns.
