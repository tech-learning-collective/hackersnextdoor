In what ways has U.S. policy influenced and designed the technologies we use to today? How are historical systematic racist practices replicating themselves into our present algorithms. How might we envision more racially equitable future technoculture? In this talk, Ari will share her research on over 50 years of U.S. policy, ways these tactics have influenced our current technologies, and how we can imagine them operating in the future&mdash;with racial equity in mind.
