teaser: Inrupt co-founder Sir Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s new initiative, Solid, promises to give control of data back to the users of the web and create a new era of secure innovation. Learn how inrupt aims to fulfil this optimistic vision from the company&rsquo;s Chief Security Architect.

When Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989, it was intended for everyone. The excitement and creativity of its early days were driven from the notion that we can all participate, and the impact was world-changing. However the original promise of the web has been compromised by forces with their own agendas of profit and politics. It&rsquo;s time to make a change. Now, inrupt is working to realize Sir Tim&rsquo;s vision and ensure the success of the Solid mission to restore data control to its owners, reshape the web as we know it and foster a new breed of democratized applications with capabilities far above and beyond anything that exists today.
