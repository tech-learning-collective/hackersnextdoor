Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the web, intended for everyone. The excitement and creativity of its early days were driven from the notion that we can all participate, and the impact was world-changing. The Internet has witnessed infamous captive human data companies recently vying to lock-up and exploit humanity, an unfortunate threat to the original promise of the web. It&rsquo;s time to make a change. Now the Solid mission aims to restore data control to its owners, reshape the web as we know it and foster a new breed of democratized applications with capabilities far above and beyond anything that exists today.
