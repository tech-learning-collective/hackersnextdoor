The original vision of the internet was a free and open space where you could share resources and communicate freely, a decentralized space where your identity didn&rsquo;t matter. When powerful entities recognized that huge profits could be made online, the technology that made up the internet was co-opted to form a centralized, traceable, &lsquo;self-centered,&rsquo; system. The decentralized vision of the internet faded from the consciousness of the general public. In this session, we&rsquo;ll look at what happened to the internet to make Tor necessary and how Tor can help you take back your privacy and freedom online.
