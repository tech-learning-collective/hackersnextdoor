teaser: Members of movements use their phones to document abuses and triumphs, communicate with collaborators, and access shared documents. All this sensitive movement data requires additional effort to keep secure prior to and during an action, and recover if things go wrong. Participants at this talk should expect to walk away with a quick-start to protect the sensitive data on their mobile phones.

In all, we will focus on two aspects of mobile security: 1. Hardening your mobile phone itself, by tweaking your privacy and security settings, and quieting those noisy — and nose-y — applications; 2. Secure mobile communications, by introducing best practices for several mobile applications for one-on-one and group chats. Time will be kept at the end of the talk for audience question and discussion, so bring your inquisitive minds!
