        AFROTECTOPIA began as a new media arts, culture and technology festival designed to recognize the contributions of Black artists, designers, technologists and activists; as well as build community amongst creatives currently working at the intersection of art, design, technology, activism and Blackness.

        The festival was created by Ari Melenciano during her last year of graduate school at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP).

        Afrotectopia began with a vision and a zero-dollar budget. After immediate support from NYU (especially ITP and other departments) and quickly going viral, the festival created a wave in the New York City tech scene&mdash;selling out shortly after being announced, building a vibrant community of Black innovators (300 attendees, 1,700 engaged online), investing over $10,000 in Black/People of Color businesses,  and creating a $5,000 scholarship for an incoming Black ITP student.

        The festival was experienced through a variety of different panels, performances, skill-sharing workshops, film screenings, lightning presentations, think tanks and more.

          After working in Ferguson, Baltimore and Cleveland, lawyers and legal activists came together to create the Black Movement-Law Project (BMLP). From 2015 through 2017 BMLP provided legal support to local communities throughout the country as they demonstrate against police brutality and systemic racism. We believe in a community centered approach&mdash;providing holistic legal and technical training with an understanding that mass defense movement legal experience is often missing from the local equation. BMLP&rsquo;s work included legal observation and traditional know your rights trainings, as well as emergency infrastructure such as jail support mechanisms designed to meet the needs of the specific community.

          When the sun goes down in Brooklyn, pirate radio stations power up, beaming renegade, culture-laden signals into Caribbean, Orthodox Jewish and Latino neighborhoods. The Brooklyn Pirate Radio Sound Map archives the sounds of an ad hoc underground community radio service that persists deep into the digital age amidst a rising tide of anti-pirate legislation and enforcement.

          The Brooklyn Pirate Radio Sound Map (BPRSM) traces the lingering connections between unlicensed radio broadcasting and Brooklyn&rsquo;s local neighborhood culture in the digital age. This ongoing archival audio project explores the conditions that allow stations to operate openly and illegally, the needs of their audiences and their effect on licensed stations. Audio samples are drawn from recordings made from 2014 to the present.

          The Calyx Institute&rsquo;s mission is to educate the public about privacy in digital communications and to develop tools that anyone can use to build &ldquo;privacy by design&rdquo; into their internet access. By developing encryption and anonymity tools that can help users maintain their privacy, we hope to make online security easier and more accessible for everyone online.

          We are a non-profit education and research organization devoted to studying, testing and developing and implementing privacy technology and tools to promote free speech, free expression, civic engagement and privacy rights on the internet and in the mobile communications industry.

          We believe that everyone deserves privacy and security online, regardless of their technological know-how. Many tools exist for encrypting online communications and keeping your data private. However, many people don't know that they need these tools or how to access them. The Calyx Institute will continue to develop these tools and educate the public on the best ways to use them, with the goal of making cybersecurity, privacy and freedom of expression accessible to everyone. Through research and development, legal advocacy and defense, and by distributing information and open source software as widely as possible for the benefit of the general public, in both democratic and repressive contexts, we hope to build a more free and accessible internet.

          Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that protects, defends, and empowers public-interest journalism in the 21st century.

          The organization works to preserve and strengthen First and Fourth Amendment rights guaranteed to the press through a variety of avenues, including the development of encryption tools, documentation of attacks on the press, training newsrooms on digital security practices, and advocating for the public&rsquo;s right to know.

          Freedom of the Press Foundation is built on the recognition that this kind of transparency journalism — from publishing the Pentagon Papers and exposing Watergate, to uncovering the NSA&rsquo;s warrantless wiretapping program and CIA secret prisons &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t just happen. It requires dogged work by journalists, and often, the courage of whistleblowers and others who work to ensure that the public actually learns what it has a right to know.

        We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.

          S.T.O.P. fights to end discriminatory surveillance. Our team challenges both individual misconduct and broader systemic failures. We craft policies that balance new technologies and age-old rights. And we educate impacted communities on how they can protect their rights.

          S.T.O.P. litigates and advocates for privacy, fighting excessive local and state-level surveillance. Our work highlights the discriminatory impact of surveillance on Muslim Americans, immigrants, and communities of color.

          S.T.O.P. fights to ensure that technological advancements don’t come at the expense of age-old rights. We hope to transform New York City and State into models for the rest of the United States of how to harness novel technologies without adversely impacting marginalized communities. S.T.O.P. also believes that directly-impacted communities are best equipped to lead this fight, and that their voices should be at the forefront for this and any movement.

          S.T.O.P. is a proud member of the Electronic Frontier Alliance, which is committed to the proposition that intellectual freedom is indispensable to a democratic society.

      image: /static/images/logo.tor.jpg
      description: |
          The Tor Project, Inc, became a 501(c)3 nonprofit in 2006, but the idea of "onion routing" began in the mid 1990s.

          Just like Tor users, the developers, researchers, and founders who've made Tor possible are a diverse group of people. But all of the people who have been involved in Tor are united by a common belief: internet users should have private access to an uncensored web.

          The need for tools safeguarding against mass surveillance became a mainstream concern thanks to the Snowden revelations in 2013. Not only was Tor instrumental to Snowden&rsquo;s whistleblowing, but content of the documents also upheld assurances that, at that time, Tor could not be cracked.

          People&rsquo;s awareness of tracking, surveillance, and censorship may have increased, but so has the prevalence of these hindrances to internet freedom. Today, the network has thousands of relays run by volunteers and millions of users worldwide. And it is this diversity that keeps Tor users safe.

          We, at the Tor Project, fight every day for everyone to have private access to an uncensored internet, and Tor has become the world's strongest tool for privacy and freedom online.

          But Tor is more than just software. It is a labor of love produced by an international community of people devoted to human rights. The Tor Project is deeply committed to transparency and the safety of its users.
