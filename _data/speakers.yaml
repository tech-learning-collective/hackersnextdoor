        AFROTECTOPIA began as a new media arts, culture and technology festival designed to recognize the contributions of Black artists, designers, technologists and activists; as well as build community amongst creatives currently working at the intersection of art, design, technology, activism and Blackness.

        The festival was created by Ari Melenciano during her last year of graduate school at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP).

        Afrotectopia began with a vision and a zero-dollar budget. After immediate support from NYU (especially ITP and other departments) and quickly going viral, the festival created a wave in the New York City tech scene&mdash;selling out shortly after being announced, building a vibrant community of Black innovators (300 attendees, 1,700 engaged online), investing over $10,000 in Black/People of Color businesses,  and creating a $5,000 scholarship for an incoming Black ITP student.

        The festival was experienced through a variety of different panels, performances, skill-sharing workshops, film screenings, lightning presentations, think tanks and more.

        The NYC chapter of the Anarcho-Tech Collective provides technological and digital infrastructure support services to anti-fascist, anti-racist, and anti-capitalist organizations in New York City. These services range from computer training for activists and advocacy groups, to direct assistance with digital components of advocacy efforts and private audits of an ally’s security posture when requested. We are an entirely volunteer-run organization operating without any licensing or legal recognition and a financial budget intentionally as close to zero as possible.

    - name: Black Movement-Law Project
      description: |
          After working in Ferguson, Baltimore and Cleveland, lawyers and legal activists have come together to create the Black Movement-Law Project. BMLP provides legal support to local communities throughout the country as they demonstrate against police brutality and systemic racism. We believe in a community centered approach&mdash;providing holistic legal and technical service with an understanding that mass defense movement legal experience is often missing from the local equation.

          BMLP facilitates a rapid response system supporting activists during mass demonstrations and arrests. We work with local community groups to educate impacted communities in understanding their rights and responding to increased militarized police presence in their communities.

          Our work includes legal observation and traditional know your rights trainings, as well as emergency infrastructure such as jail support mechanisms designed to meet the needs of the specific community. Further we have a network of national human and civil rights lawyers that assist local communities in urgent legal needs and long-term impact litigation.

        We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.

          S.T.O.P. fights to end discriminatory surveillance. Our team challenges both individual misconduct and broader systemic failures. We craft policies that balance new technologies and age-old rights. And we educate impacted communities on how they can protect their rights.

          S.T.O.P. litigates and advocates for privacy, fighting excessive local and state-level surveillance. Our work highlights the discriminatory impact of surveillance on Muslim Americans, immigrants, and communities of color.

          S.T.O.P. fights to ensure that technological advancements don’t come at the expense of age-old rights. We hope to transform New York City and State into models for the rest of the United States of how to harness novel technologies without adversely impacting marginalized communities. S.T.O.P. also believes that directly-impacted communities are best equipped to lead this fight, and that their voices should be at the forefront for this and any movement.

          S.T.O.P. is a proud member of the Electronic Frontier Alliance, which is committed to the proposition that intellectual freedom is indispensable to a democratic society.

          [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/) is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia, Information Technology, and radical political practice.

          Founded and operated exclusively by radical queer and femme technologists, we offer unparalleled free, by-donation, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).

          Our students are primarily people of marginalized groups and other individuals who are politically engaged.

          Unlike coding bootcamps that focus on moving the highest number of students through rote memorization exercises for the goal of job placement, Tech Learning Collective teachers facilitate foundational skill building through Socratic discussion and kinetic, experience-based training.

      description: |
          The Tor Project, Inc, became a 501(c)3 nonprofit in 2006, but the idea of "onion routing" began in the mid 1990s.

          Just like Tor users, the developers, researchers, and founders who've made Tor possible are a diverse group of people. But all of the people who have been involved in Tor are united by a common belief: internet users should have private access to an uncensored web.

          The need for tools safeguarding against mass surveillance became a mainstream concern thanks to the Snowden revelations in 2013. Not only was Tor instrumental to Snowden&rsquo;s whistleblowing, but content of the documents also upheld assurances that, at that time, Tor could not be cracked.

          People&rsquo;s awareness of tracking, surveillance, and censorship may have increased, but so has the prevalence of these hindrances to internet freedom. Today, the network has thousands of relays run by volunteers and millions of users worldwide. And it is this diversity that keeps Tor users safe.

          We, at the Tor Project, fight every day for everyone to have private access to an uncensored internet, and Tor has become the world's strongest tool for privacy and freedom online.

          But Tor is more than just software. It is a labor of love produced by an international community of people devoted to human rights. The Tor Project is deeply committed to transparency and the safety of its users.
