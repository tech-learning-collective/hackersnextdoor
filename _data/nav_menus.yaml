# This file describes the navigation menus present in various places
# across your Web site. Each menu has a unique identifier and can be
# translated into multiple languages, localized regions, or both. The
# structure of the navigation menus are:
#
# ```yaml
# menu_identifier:
#   ISO_639_language_tag:
#     - url: /path/to/link/to
#       text: Display text of menu item 
#       title_text: Tooltip text of menu link.
# ```
#
# Common menu identifiers are:
#
# * `main`
# * `sidebar`
#
# Each menu should have at least one language that matches the default
# language set in the site-wide `_config.yaml` file's `lang` property.
# For example, if have set `lang: de` in your `_config.yaml` file, your
# menus must have at least the `de` language configured here.
