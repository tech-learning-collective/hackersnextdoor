*Hackers Next Door* is an open-to-the-public information security conference featuring invitation-only presentations by the best of the tri-state area&rsquo;s cybersecurity trainers, privacy rights advocacy groups, and their constituencies.

The two-day conference is a unique opportunity for anyone interested in how to protect themselves online to participate in a skill-sharing and educational convergence where they can meet one another, compare notes with peers and colleagues, and learn practical techniques from the region&rsquo;s top cybersecurity instructors, legal experts, and experienced activists.

By enhancing cybersecurity training for everyone, and increasing public awareness of digital civil liberties issues, *Hackers Next Door* gives invited speakers a chance to showcase and workshop their educational methods and materials to and with an audience of like-minded and impassioned community organizers, activists, and fellow security and privacy trainers so that we can all learn from one another&rsquo;s experience and perspective.
