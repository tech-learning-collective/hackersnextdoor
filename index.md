    Next Door
</h1>

The Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s Hackers Next Door conference is an open-to-the-public, two-day information security conference featuring invitation-only presentations bringing together the best of the Tri-State area&rsquo;s leading cybersecurity trainers, online privacy advocacy groups, and their constituencies for a skill-sharing and educational convergence to meet and learn from one another.

Aiming to strengthen and enhance digital security training and awareness of digital civil liberties issues for all, *Hackers Next Door* gives invited groups a chance to showcase their training methods and educational material to an audience of like-minded and impassioned community organizers, activists, and fellow security and privacy trainers so that we can all learn from one another&rsquo;s experience and perspective.
