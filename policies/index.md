# Event Policies

TL;DR: Hackers Next Door is a [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/) event, and as such the same policies enforced at all TLC events are enforced at the conference. Specifically, this means:

* Racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, capitalist advocacy, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior *will* result in your immediate removal from the venue. See our [Social Rules](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules) for more information.
* We do not offer refunds.
